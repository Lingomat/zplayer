  "ABOUT": {
    "TITLE": "About",
    "1": "Zahwa is an app where you show how to make things using a combination of pictures and talk. It was originally intended for talking about food preparation, but it can be used to document any procedural or how-to knowledge. Zahwa supports oral translation, in the sense that you can listen to instructions in one language before speaking them in another language, to enable more people to follow along.",
    "2": "Zahwa's basic function is to import a series of photos. The user then narrates the images as a form of slide-show, advancing  through the slides as they speak. The app also records touch gestures as the user speaks. This is helpful to draw attention to certain items in a picture as they are referred to in speech, and gestures can also indicate things like speed and direction.",
    "3": "One of our goals is to share cultural knowledge across languages. The app provides the means to perform oral translations of recipes in a manner similar to the Aikuma Android app. Zahwa is part of the <a href='http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/'>Aikuma Project</a> which seeks to employ cutting edge technologies to accelerate the documentation of endangered languages.",
    "4": "Zahwa is the first of a new kind of language documentation tool which we call language documentation 2.0, loosely after the Web 2.0. Traditionally, digital tools for language documentation are used by experts. With Zahwa, we hope to engage ordinary speakers of small languages. Our aim is for Zahwa to be genuinely useful to speakers by itself, but to also contribute towards a central data store. Eventually, different kinds of apps will connect to the data store.",
    "5": "The Zahwa app was conceived by <a href='http://www.stevenbird.net/'>Steven Bird</a> at the <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/ldtoolssummit/home'>Digital Tools and Methods Summit</a> at the University of Melbourne in June 2016 with assistance from <a href='https://ephe.academia.edu/AminaMettouchi'>Amina Mettouchi</a>. Zahwa was developed by <a href='https://unimelb.academia.edu/MatBettinson'>Mat Bettinson</a> (風茂修), a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne.",
    "6": "Zahwa is supported by the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (<a href='http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/'>CoEDL</a>), the NSF <a href='https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1423406'>Award 1423406</a> <i>Language Induction meets Language Documentation: Leveraging bilingual aligned audio for learning and preserving languages</i> (David Chiang and Steven Bird), and the Australian Government Postgraduate Award scheme (APA).",
    "7": "Special thanks to the <a href='http://www.dmtip.gov.tw/Eng/Saisiyat.htm'>Saisiyat</a> community in rural North Western Taiwan. This project would not have been possible without their enthusiasm for maintaining their own language, and their great hospitality and patience.",

    "TITLE": "FAQ",
    "Q0": "How can we report a bug?",
    "A0": "Please use the <a href='https://plus.google.com/communities/115628487219035842652/stream/27625609-5e1e-4059-8703-e6c13e46f32d'>bug reports</a> section of the Zahwa Google+ community. Thanks!",
    "Q1": "Will there be an iPhone version?",
    "A1": "As a hybrid app we believe this should be straightforward. We would be happy to cooperate with any developers who want to make an iPhone version.",
    "Q2": "Does Zahwa work offline?",
    "A2": "Yes! Zahwa was built with the assumption that internet access is temporary. There are settings to select automatic, manual or Wi-Fi sync.",
    "Q3": "Can we help translate the app into my language?",
    "A3": "Yes please. We have followed best practices for internationalization so further localizations should be straightforward.",
    "Q4": "Is Zahwa open source?",
    "A4": "The entire app probably wont be open source. We plan to publish some of the components in Zahwa as open source reusable components to accelerate language app development. There will be more happening in 2018.",
    "Q5": "Can we access the data?",
    "A5": "Zahwa has a backup/export feature that selectively exports data into a zip file. This contains all of the images, audio files and metadata in json files. If you mean accessing the synced data online, a public API is in the works. We're also planning to export Zahwa data to a traditional archive and that might be easier to interact with depending on your needs.",
    "Q6": "What technology was used to build Zahwa?",
    "A6": "Zahwa is an Ionic app. That means it's an Angular web app, written in Typescript, bundled with Cordova and a number of native plugins. The online database is built on Firebase and Google cloud storage.",
    "Q7": "Since Zahwa is also available in Chinese, will it work in China?",
    "A7": "The offline features will work but the online services aren't available in China."
